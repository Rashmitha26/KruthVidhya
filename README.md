# KruthVidhya

## Introduction

KruthVidhya is an Android mobile application designed to identify potential signs of dyslexia in children, especially in the early stages of development. This app aims to assess the reading and writing 
abilities of children, aged 3-5 years, by analyzing their ability to spell, pronounce, and write words. 

By capturing both speech and written inputs, the app helps identify difficulties children may face in reading and writing. Through careful analysis of these activities, the app provides insights into the 
coordination and fine motor control of the child, which are often impacted in those with dyslexia.
It can assist parents, teachers, and healthcare professionals in spotting potential learning disorders and intervening early. By analyzing both the speech and writing abilities of children, 
the app helps identify patterns of behavior that may point to dyslexia, allowing for timely intervention.

## Features

1. **Speech Recognition**  
   - Children are asked to pronounce a given word, which is captured via the app’s speech-to-text feature.  
   - The speech is converted into text and analyzed for accuracy.

2. **Handwriting Recognition**  
   - Children are prompted to write the word on the screen.  
   - The written text is captured using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the characters and assess the handwriting quality.

3. **Accuracy Comparison**  
   - The app compares the audio input (speech-to-text) with the written input (OCR) to check for consistency and correctness.  
   - Inaccuracies or mismatches between spoken and written words may indicate potential signs of dyslexia.

4. **Coordination and Fine Motor Control Analysis**  
   - The app assesses the child’s coordination by requiring them to perform two activities simultaneously: speaking and writing.  
   - Poor coordination or inconsistencies between the two tasks may suggest difficulties often associated with dyslexia.

5. **Dyslexia Risk Assessment**  
   - The app calculates a score based on the accuracy of both speech and writing inputs.  
   - A low score or significant discrepancies between the spoken and written words may indicate a higher risk of dyslexia.


## How It Works

1. **Test Procedure**  
   - The app presents a word to the child.  
   - The child is prompted to pronounce the word aloud.  
   - The app captures the pronunciation through the device’s microphone and converts it into text.  
   - The child is then asked to write the same word on the screen using the touch interface.  
   - The written text is captured through OCR technology, which scans and extracts the characters.

2. **Validation**  
   - The app compares the results from speech-to-text and OCR.  
   - If the words match, the child receives a score incrementally.  
   - If discrepancies are found, the app tracks the accuracy to help identify areas of difficulty.

3. **Result Analysis**  
   - After completing the test, the app analyzes the results, including the accuracy of the spoken and written responses.  
   - Based on the comparison and analysis, score is generated which reflects whether signs of dyslexia are present.

## Technologies Used

- **Speech-to-Text**: Converts the child’s spoken word into text for analysis.
- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**: Recognizes the child’s written word and converts it into text.
- **Android SDK**: Used to develop the app for Android devices.

## Requirements

- Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) or later.
- Audio, Camera and Internet permissions enabled for the app to function properly.

## How to Use

1. Open the app and follow the on-screen instructions.
2. The app will prompt the child with a word to read aloud and write.
3. Wait as the app captures the child’s spoken and written responses.
4. Once the test is complete, review the results.

This app is **not intended** to diagnose dyslexia or any other learning disorder definitively. It is a tool for early detection and risk assessment. For a formal diagnosis, please consult a qualified healthcare professional or specialist in child development.
